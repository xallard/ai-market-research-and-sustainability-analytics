# consumer_feedback_analysis.py
# Script for analyzing consumer feedback and market reports in AI-Market-Research-and-Sustainability-Analytics
#testing

# For the AI-Market-Research-and-Sustainability-Analytics project, we can create a fictitious Python script focused on analyzing consumer feedback and market reports. This script, possibly named consumer_feedback_analysis.py, will be dedicated to processing, understanding, and extracting valuable insights from various forms of consumer feedback and textual market reports. This file would fit well within the consumer-insights module of the project.

# In this script:

# A ConsumerFeedbackAnalyzer class is created with methods to load data, preprocess consumer feedback, perform sentiment analysis, and extract key themes.
# SpaCy is used for sentiment analysis, and scikit-learn's TF-IDF vectorizer along with KMeans clustering is used to extract key themes from the feedback.
# The script assumes the presence of a CSV file containing consumer feedback.
# This script, as part of the consumer-insights module in the AI-Market-Research-and-Sustainability-Analytics project, would be crucial in understanding consumer sentiments and identifying key themes in their feedback, which is vital for market research and sustainability analysis.
